# Open Conference
A free open-source text, audio, and video conferencing application.

Open Conference allows friends, communities, or companies to host their own Open Conference Server on-prem or in the cloud for real-time text, audio, and video conferencing. Built on top of ElectronJS, the Open Conference Client can run on Windows, MacOS, or Linux allowing nearly anyone to connect and chat. Open Conference servers can be public or private using either password, invite code, or one-time invite links to authorize connections. The Open Conference Client can also be domain-connected to an Open Conference Managment Server, allowing communities or enterprise environments to have fine control over what the Open Conference Client can do, servers they are pre-authorized to join and more.

Open Conference is a very immature project, and as such you should expect bugs throughout the application. Please familiarize yourself with the project's MIT license to better understand how you can use the Open Conference free open-source software.
